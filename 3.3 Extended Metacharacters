Step 1 The preceding character appears one or more times.
View the lines that contain one or more occurrences of "192" in the NIC information.
[root@openEuler ~]# ifconfig | grep -E '(192)+'
 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
[root@openEuler ~]#


Step 2 The preceding character appears zero or one time.
View the lines that contain zero or more occurrences of "255" after "255." in the NIC
information.
[root@openEuler ~]# ifconfig | grep -E '255.(255)?'
 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
 inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0
[root@openEuler ~]#


Step 3 The or character.
View the lines that contain zero or more occurrences of "255" or "0" after "255." in the
NIC information.
[root@openEuler ~]# ifconfig | grep -E '255.(255|0)+'
 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
 inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0
[root@openEuler ~]#


Step 4 Specify the number of repetitions of preceding characters in the NIC information.
View the lines that contain two occurrences of "255." after "255.".
[root@openEuler ~]# ifconfig | grep -E '255.(255.){2}'
 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
[root@openEuler ~]#
View the lines that contain two or more occurrences of "255." after "255.".
[root@openEuler ~]# ifconfig | grep -E '255.(255.){2,}'
 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
[root@openEuler ~]#
View the lines that contain a maximum of two occurrences of "255." after "255.".
[root@openEuler ~]# ifconfig | grep -E '255.(255.){,2}'
 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
 inet 127.0.0.1 netmask 255.0.0.0
[root@openEuler ~]#
View the lines that contain one to two occurrences of "255." after "255.".
[root@openEuler ~]# ifconfig | grep -E '255.(255.){1,2}'
 inet 192.168.0.22 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255
[root@openEuler ~]#
